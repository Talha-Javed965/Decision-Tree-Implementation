( When the `pandas` library is used in Python, it provides data structures and functions for efficiently working with structured data,
  particularly in the form of tables (DataFrame objects),facilitating tasks such as data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. )
( When the `numpy` library is used in Python, it provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection 
  of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently, making it an essential tool for numerical computing tasks. )
( When the `matplotlib.pyplot` module is used in Python, it provides a collection of functions and classes for creating static,
  interactive, and animated visualizations. It is commonly used for generating plots, charts, histograms, and other types 
  of graphical representations of data. )
( When the `tree` module is imported from `sklearn` (Scikit-learn) in Python, it provides access to the DecisionTreeClassifier
  and DecisionTreeRegressor classes, allowing users to create decision tree models for classification and regression tasks, respectively. 
  In summary, while both classes utilize decision tree algorithms, they are tailored to different types of prediction tasks:
  classification for DecisionTreeClassifier and regression for DecisionTreeRegressor. Depending on the nature of the 
  target variable in your dataset (categorical or continuous), you would choose the appropriate class for building your predictive model.)
( When the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module is used in Python, it allows for the splitting of
  datasets into training and testing subsets, enabling evaluation and validation of machine learning models on unseen data. )

  The Decision Tree algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.
  It works by recursively partitioning the input data into subsets based on the values of input features, with the goal of
  creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents
  the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the predicted class or value.

  Here's a brief overview of how the Decision Tree algorithm works:

1. Feature Selection:
   - The algorithm selects the best feature from the input dataset to split the data into subsets.
   -  The goal is to find the feature that maximizes the homogeneity or purity of the subsets.

2. Splitting:
   - Once a feature is selected, the algorithm splits the data into subsets based on different values of that feature.
   - Each subset corresponds to a different branch of the tree.

3. Recursive Partitioning:
   - The splitting process is repeated recursively on each subset until certain stopping criteria are met.
   -  This typically involves reaching a maximum tree depth, having a minimum number of samples in a node, or achieving perfect purity.

4. Leaf Node Prediction:
   - Once the splitting process stops, each leaf node of the tree represents a class label (for classification) or a predicted value (for regression).

5. Prediction:
   - To make predictions for new data instances, the algorithm traverses the decision tree from the root node down
     to a leaf node based on the values of input features.
     The predicted class or value associated with the leaf node is then assigned to the new instance.

Decision Trees are popular due to their simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.
They are also the building blocks of more complex ensemble methods such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.
However, they are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree is deep or the dataset is noisy, which can be mitigated through
techniques like pruning or using ensemble methods.

Entropy measures the randomness or disorder within a dataset. It quantifies the impurity of a dataset before and after a split based on a particular feature.
A low entropy indicates a more homogeneous (less impure) dataset, while a high entropy indicates a more heterogeneous (more impure) dataset.

Information gain measures the effectiveness of a feature in classifying the dataset. It quantifies the reduction in entropy (or increase in purity) achieved
by splitting the dataset based on a particular feature. A high information gain indicates that splitting the dataset based on the chosen feature results
in more homogeneous subsets (lower entropy) and, consequently, better classification.
